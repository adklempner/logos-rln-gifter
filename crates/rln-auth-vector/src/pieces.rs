//! The pieces a vector is composed of. Verify side: a [`Scheme`] proves an
//! [`Identity`] from a signature over the binding digest; an [`Authoriser`]
//! accepts that identity (and binds any evidence it needs). Produce side: a
//! [`Signer`] makes the scheme part, a [`Claimant`] gathers the evidence.
//!
//! Two failure channels everywhere: [`Outcome::Reject`] is the requester's
//! problem and becomes a `Verdict` (or, on the produce side, an error the
//! requester caused); `Err(String)` is the operator's or the host's problem
//! and becomes the `{"error"}` envelope.
